# SENet
 This repository hosts the codebase for a research project that utilizes Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet) combined with an Attention Mechanism to automate the detection of coffee leaf diseases. This innovative approach leverages deep learning techniques to enhance the accuracy of classifying diseases across coffee plantations by focusing on crucial leaf areas.
